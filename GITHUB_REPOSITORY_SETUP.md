# 🚀 Final GitHub Repository Setup Commands

Your DocumentAI MT Analysis System is now ready for GitHub! Here are the final commands to push to your private repository:

## 📋 **Step 1: Create Private GitHub Repository**

1. Go to **https://github.com**
2. Click **"New Repository"** (green button)

cd "c:\Personal_Projects\DocumentAI"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DocumentAI-MT-Analysis.git

# Verify remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin master

# Future pushes (after making changes)
git push
```

2. Add repository secrets:
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

## 📚 **Step 4: Add Collaborators (Optional)**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Manage access**
2. Click **"Invite a collaborator"**
3. Add team members with appropriate permissions:

   - **Management**: Read access

## 🏷️ **Step 5: Create First Release**

```powershell
# Create and push a tag for v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "🚀 Initial Release: DocumentAI MT Analysis System v1.0.0

✅ Complete nuclear facility MT determination system
✅ Azure OpenAI GPT-4 integration with nuclear expertise
✅ Professional TypeScript frontend with corporate styling
✅ FedRAMP-ready security architecture
✅ Comprehensive documentation suite

Nuclear facility production ready."

git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📋 **Step 6: Repository Configuration Checklist**
