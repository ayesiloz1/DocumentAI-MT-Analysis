- ✅ **FedRAMP Ready** - TypeScript architecture with security focus
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance** - 10 CFR 73 cybersecurity standards
- ✅ **Document Security** - Generated MT documents properly classified

## 🚨 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

### **Security Incident Procedure**
1. **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email immediately:** security@[your-domain].com
3. **Include:** Detailed description, impact assessment, steps to reproduce
4. **Response time:** Critical issues within 4 hours, others within 24 hours

### **Nuclear Facility Specific Issues**
For vulnerabilities affecting nuclear facility operations:
- **Immediate notification** required for safety-related impacts
- **Coordinate with plant cybersecurity** teams
- **Follow NRC reporting requirements** if applicable

### **Severity Classification**
- **🔴 CRITICAL:** Potential impact to nuclear safety systems
- **🟠 HIGH:** Unauthorized access to plant data
- **🟡 MEDIUM:** Data integrity or availability issues
- **🟢 LOW:** Minor security improvements

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

### **Development Security**
```bash
# Secure environment setup
cp .env.template .env.local
# Never commit .env files with real API keys

# Code security scanning
npm audit
dotnet list package --vulnerable
```

### **API Key Security**
```json
// ❌ NEVER do this
{
  "AzureOpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "actual-api-key-here"
  }
}

// ✅ ALWAYS do this
{
  "AzureOpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

### **Nuclear Facility Deployment**
```bash
# Production deployment security
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="secure-key-from-vault"
export ENVIRONMENT="PRODUCTION"
export SECURITY_LEVEL="NUCLEAR_FACILITY"
```
